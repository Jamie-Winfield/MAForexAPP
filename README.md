# MAForexAPP

A simple IOS app which can be used to display refreshable forex financial data for multiple forex pairs 
with the ability to view graphs of their price changes and favouite different pairs to find them easily.

This app uses the fixer API (https://apilayer.com/marketplace/fixer-api) to gather forex price data. Because of this
to download and use the apikey variable contained inside webservice.swift will need to be replaced with a working apikey from fixer.
